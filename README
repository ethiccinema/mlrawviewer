Installation
------------
1. You need python 2.7 or later python 2 release, not python 3

2. You need to install pyOpenGL, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-opengl"

3. You need to install numpy, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-numpy"

4. The playback will be faster if you build the included bitunpack module. Do. "python setup.py build". Then either link or copy the bitunpack binary from the build sub-directory to the same place as the script

Usage
-----

-/mlrawviewer.py <path_to_ML_RAW_or_MLV_base_file>

If the Raw file is the first in a numbered set, the other files will be used automatically.
Playback will happen at around 25FPS or the closest achievable if constrained by disk read speed.

Keys
----

SPACE - Pause/Unpause playback

TAB - Toggle between initial windowed mode and fullscreen
