About

MlRawViewer is a cross-platform viewer for raw video files produced by the Magic Lantern add-on software
for Canon DSLR cameras. (See http://www.magiclantern.fm/ for more details).

It supports both the original RAW format, and the newer MLV (RAW v2.0) format in both
single and multi-file versions. It can also play CinemaDNG file sets.

It can act as a front end to ffmpeg for encoding raw files into another video
format such as ProRes.

The program is written in python, and makes use of OpenGL for image processing in order to be 
able to display videos at their intended frame rate. This also depends on you having
good file read speed in your computer.

It has mainly been developed and tested on Linux, but it has also been packaged
for Mac and Windows.

License
-------

Most of the is supplied under a BSD-style license. See the source code.

The file amaze_demosaic_RT.c is licensed with GPLv3, hence binary distributions which include
that file for CPU demosaicing must be licensed with GPLv3.

Installation from binary package
--------------------------------

Mac OS X:
Open the DMG containing the app, and drag the app icon to the Applications folder.
Select a file to open with right click, and "Open With" MlRawViewer.
You can make the association permanent so all similar files with open automatically.

Windows:
Open the folder and drag the app to your local disk.
Set the file association so supported files are opened with MlRawViewer.

Installation from source
------------------------
1. You need python 2.7 or later python 2 release, not python 3

2. You need to install pyOpenGL, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-opengl"

3. You need to install numpy, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-numpy"

4. The playback will be faster if you build the included bitunpack module. Do. "python setup.py build". Then either link or copy the bitunpack binary from the build sub-directory to the same place as the script

Usage (command line)
--------------------

-/mlrawviewer.py <path_to_ML_RAW_or_MLV_base_file> [<wav_file_to_play_along_with_video>] [<output_file_name_for_encoding>]

If the Raw file is the first in a numbered set, the other files will be used automatically.
Playback will happen at the file frame rate or the closest achievable if constrained by disk read speed.

Encoding is made using the version of "ffmpeg" found either in the scritp directory or on the path. Currently it tries to encode
with the "prores_ks" codec, which may only be found in newer versions of (real) ffmpeg. You can download a suitable (e.g. static) version of ffmpeg from http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

A new file can be dragged onto an existing window and will be 
loaded (GLFW backend only).

Usage (gui)
-----------

The timeline bar can be clicked to jump to anywhere in the current file.

State icons along the left are as follows:

- Fullscreen/windows mode
- Drop-frame mode (clock) or non-frop-frame mode
- Colour curve (sRGB, 709, linear, hdr or log)
- Demosaic quality
- Export type & export state
- Playing/paused

They can be clicked to change the current state.

On the bottom right are a brightness (exposure) bar and a white balance box. Also, clicking anywhere else in the image will set the white balance using the given pixel as a neutral colour.

Keys
----

SPACE - Pause/Unpause playback

TAB - Toggle between initial windowed mode and fullscreen

LEFT/RIGHT CURSOR - Jump back/forward 1 second

COMMA(,)/PERIOD(.) - Nudge back/forward by 1 frame (works best when paused)

UP/DOWN CURSOR - Increase/decrease brightness

0, 1, 2, 3 - Change White Balance

7, 4 - Change red multiplier up and down by 0.01

9, 6 - Change blue multiplier up and down by 0.01

F - Toggle between drop-frame mode allowing synchronised audio playback, or sequential frame mode and no audio

Q - Toggle between fast and high-quality demosaicing for playback (high-quality is used automatically when paused)

A - Toggle anamorphic aspect to take into account the 1.4x squeeze from shooting 50p/60p

S - Toggle anamorphic aspect to take into account anamorphic lenses (1.33x, 1.4x, 1.5x, 2.0x)

W - File dialog to choose the export directory

D - Choose export type, MOV or DNG

E - Start exporting from the start of the marked range to the export directory. Will use the source name with ".MOV" or "_DNG" appended.

T - Toggle between sRGB gamma, Rec.709 gamma, linear, global tone mapping, and log mapping curves

J/K - Change to previous/next MLV/RAW file in same directory as current file

V/B/N/M - Slide audio file start by -0.5,-0.05,+0.05,+0.5 seconds

I/O - Set IN/OUT marks. IN mark must be before the OUT mark. OUT mark must be after the IN mark

U/P - Jump to the previous/next marks

R - Reset the marks to start/end of the file

L - Toggle looping or play-once mode
