About

MlRawViewer is a cross-platform viewer for raw video files produced by the Magic Lantern add-on software
for Canon DSLR cameras. (See http://www.magiclantern.fm/ for more details).

It supports both the original RAW format, and the newer MLV (RAW v2.0) format in both
single and multi-file versions.

The program is written in python, and makes use of OpenGL for image processing in order to be 
able to display videos at their intended frame rate. This also depends on you having
good file read speed in your computer.

It has mainly been developed and tested on Linux, but it has also been used on Mac and Windows. 
However, it does currently assume you are able to set up the python runtime yourself. 
(For Mac and Windows you might find other alternatives which are easier to get going).

License
-------

The software is supplied under a BSD-style license. See the source code.

Installation
------------
1. You need python 2.7 or later python 2 release, not python 3

2. You need to install pyOpenGL, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-opengl"

3. You need to install numpy, e.g. on Ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-numpy"

4. The playback will be faster if you build the included bitunpack module. Do. "python setup.py build". Then either link or copy the bitunpack binary from the build sub-directory to the same place as the script

Usage
-----

-/mlrawviewer.py <path_to_ML_RAW_or_MLV_base_file>

If the Raw file is the first in a numbered set, the other files will be used automatically.
Playback will happen at around 25FPS or the closest achievable if constrained by disk read speed.

Keys
----

TAB - Toggle between initial windowed mode and fullscreen

LEFT/RIGHT CURSOR - Jump back/forward 1 second
